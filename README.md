Special thanks to [@SQ77](https://github.com/SQ77) for helping with the deployment ü•≥

## Overview

My wife and I found ourselves with a handful of exercise packages across various studios and it was getting troublesome trying to find classes we wanted to go for. That was how this idea was born - to create a telegram bot containing the schedules of all the studios we go to!

## Studios Supported

_Note: Screenshots are not updated to show support for all studios. Usage for different studios are the same._

- Absolute
- Ally
- Anarchy
- Barry's
- Revolution

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variables to set

- PYTHONPATH = "src" (required)
  - Value should be set to "src" to ensure that Python can locate the modules in the src folder correctly.

- BOT_TOKEN (required)
  - To be able to run the bot, you will need to get a bot token from @botfather. FreeCodeCamp has a nice guide [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-using-python/) that was used as a reference for this project.
- TELEGRAM_BOT_EXTERNAL_URL (required)
  - This will be used as the base URL for the server that listens for webhook requests.
  - For local testing, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) can be used. After setting it up and running it with `ngrok http <port>`, you will get a URL like <https://43b1-121-192-143-222.ngrok-free.app>. Set TELEGRAM_BOT_EXTERNAL_URL to this value.
- WEBHOOK_PATH (required)
  - The webhook path can be any value. It defines the route where your Telegram bot's webhook will be set as well as the route for the server to listen for requests on.
- PORT (not required, defaults to 80)
  - The port that the server will be listening on.

## Unit Tests
